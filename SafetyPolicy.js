        Driving on roads may be a pleasant experience, however, one has to consider the safety factor equally well. Even a skilled driver cannot avoid the risk factor while driving. A little bump or minor accident in such cases can result in huge loss. Thus, the only best way to remain prepared against such circumstances is to buy a car insurance. It's the smartest way to financially secure you and your car.

So, when you buy a vehicle, be it a bike or car, you must get it insured before you start driving it on the road. Remember, a car insurance policy is not a choice, it's a necessity and mandatory by the Motor Vehicles Act in India.

        Break-in-insurance is when the Policy lapses due to non-renewal of the Policy on time. As per the law, an owner should cover his/her car with at least third party insurance at all times. If you have a break in your car insurance, you can-
Approach another insurance company to renew policy-if it has been less than 90 days since the Policy lapsed. In this case, you may be able to retain your No Claim Bonus.
Obtain a new Insurance Policy-if it has been more than 90 days since the Policy lapsed.
In either case, you have to get your car re-inspected.

        An endorsement is a document that incorporates amendments and additions in the existing terms of the policy. It is a written evidence of an agreed change to policy. If the policyholder needs to purchase more coverage, add riders or change the scope of the existing insurance policy, they can approach the insurance company to make the required changes by way of an endorsement.

An endorsement can be issued at the time of purchase, mid-term or during renewal period. It can be used to provide additional benefits and cover (e.g., legal liability to driver) or to impose restrictions (e.g., accidental damage deductible). Subsequently, any amendments regarding policyholders documents such as change of name, change of address, change of vehicle, etc. can also be implemented by way of an endorsement. The wordings of those endorsements are provided in the tariff.

For those vehicles that are outdated or exceeding 5 years of age, IDV value will be the value accepted by both- the insurance company and insured. Besides, the value of obsolete vehicles and those exceeding 5 years of age is evaluated by our assessment team with the help of several resources such as second hand car dealers, IMAs, panel of Surveyors, etc.
